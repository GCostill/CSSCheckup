        <h1>Klaus</h1>
        <p id="firstid">When I was first looking for a dog, I was interested in getting a hypoallergenic and calm breed to have as a kind of therapy dog. I came across a pet website and found a dog named Freya that I really wanted. Freya was already adopted, but was part of a rescue center that told me they just rescued a momma that had puppies and they all got adopted except for the runt of the litter. His name was Klaus.</p>

        <h2>Puppy's Beginning</h2>
        <p id="secondid">We decided to get Klaus, and when we went to pick him up and I saw him for the first time, all I could say was "awwww puppy." And since them, I haven't called him anything else but "Puppy."</p>

        <h2>Crazy Dog</h2>
        <p id="thirdid">Puppy definitely wasn't anything that we were looking for. He sheds like a husky and has sooo much energy that he's not afraid to tackle you with. He's can be a misbehaving psycho sometimes... but he's my psycho and I love him for it. He's a very smart dog and loves learning and going on adventures just as much as I do! He has so much potential, and I can't wait to help him grow to reach that potential!</p>
